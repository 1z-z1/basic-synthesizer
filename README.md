This project has been a great experience so far in working with C++, design, and sound. I have not fully completed it at this time but it has a GUI and makes sound so I feel it is deserving of some documentation. At the time of recording the video of the synthesizer, I had not added "dBA" to the value suffix of the amplitude, which I believe is the proper measurement of amplitude in this sense...(or so Google says), and added spacing between the function values and suffixes.

More info coming soonâ„¢
